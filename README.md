# Rules

The rules of the game are very simple. The game will let you throw a toss, which will determine whether you will bat or bowl first.

You can use your hand to make the numbers from 0 through 6 as follows:
‚úä()0, ‚òùÔ∏è(1), ‚úåÔ∏è(2) ... üñê(5), üëç(6)

## If you're batting:
- Try to play numbers other than the number the bowler plays. Your runs will accumulate as long as you're not out.
- If you play the same number you lose a wicket. You can choose how many wickets to play with. There are no overs in this game and you keep playing until you are all bowled out.

## If you're bowling:
- Try to predict what the batsman will play and try to match the number. 
- There is no fielding in this game and the only way to get the batsman out is by playing the same number.

## What is Cricket?
Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played with eleven players on each team on a circular field. There is a rectangular [pitch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Cricket_pitch.svg/750px-Cricket_pitch.svg.png) in the center of this field, and on either end there are [wickets](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Cricket_Stumps_en.svg/260px-Cricket_Stumps_en.svg.png).

There are two innings in cricket, a batting and a bowling/fielding innning. Innings are decided by a coin toss at the beginning of the game. Each inning lasts for n number of overs, and one over consists of six balls. One "ball" consists of the fielding side bowling to the batsman. There are various formats of the game, and there can be as little as 10 overs to as many as 90 overs. The popular formats of the game are 20 over games (T20 games) and 50 over games (ODI or One Day International games).

### Batting Side
- When one batsman strikes the ball, the batsmen can choose to "run" between the wickets. If they are outside of the crease and the fielding side strikes the wicket with the ball, the batsmen are out. They can choose to run 1, 2 or 3 runs.
- If the batsman hits the ball to the edge of the field, it's a boundary, similar to a home run from baseball. If the ball rolls over the edge it's a score of 4 runs, if it flies over the boundary it is 6 runs. 
- If the ball hits the stumps or the bails, or if the ball hits the legs before hitting the bat, the batsman is out.

### Bowling Side
- There is one wicket keeper who sits behind the wicket. He is the only player who is allowed to have gloves to catch the ball.
The captain can arrange his players around the field to anticipate the batsman's hits. If they catch the ball the batsman is out. They must try to prevent the batsmen from taking runs and scoring boundaries.

The first team to bat puts up a score. To win, the second team must be able to score at least one more run.
